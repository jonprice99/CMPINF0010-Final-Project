Abstract: 


Mark's Conclusion:
With my metric of budgeted amount for projetcs, I found Greenfield and Central Business district to be the best neighbourhoods. Greenfield would be considered the most invested neighbourhood if accounting for the total budget, which include completed, planned, in-progress, and canceled. However, Central Business District would be the most invested neighbourhood if accounting only for completed and planned projects. These budgeted amount for projects go towards the construction of parks, playgrounds, and other facilities which improve the quality of life in a neighborhood.
