## Abstract 


## Mark's Conclusion
With my metric of budgeted amount for projetcs, I found Greenfield and Central Business district to be the best neighbourhoods. Greenfield would be considered the most invested neighbourhood if accounting for the total budget, which include completed, planned, in-progress, and canceled. However, Central Business District would be the most invested neighbourhood if accounting only for completed and planned projects. These budgeted amount for projects go towards the construction of parks, playgrounds, and other facilities which improve the quality of life in a neighborhood.

## Eyasped's Conclusion
When anyone looking into a prospective neighborhood, look at the crime rate. Even Though crimes are frequently intense in big cities, it doesn’t imply the neighborhood is certainly safe even if it’s in a small town. Crime statistics are usually good indicators of neighborhood safety and safety is one of the essential indicators of a best neighborhood. But it’s not always easy to spot crime. Your quality of life can depend on your neighborhood. With the metric of police incident report, Mount Oliver Boro is the 
safest neighborhood to live with the smallest police incident report. Therefore, I found Mt. Oliver Boro to be the best neighborhood in the city of Pittsburgh.
