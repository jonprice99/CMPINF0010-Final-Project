## Mark's Conclusion
With my metric of budgeted amount for projects, I found Greenfield and Central Business district to be the best neighborhoods. Greenfield would be considered the most invested neighborhood if accounting for the total budget, which include completed, planned, in-progress, and canceled. However, Central Business District would be the most invested neighborhood if accounting only for completed and planned projects. These budgeted amount for projects go towards the construction of parks, playgrounds, and other facilities which improve the quality of life in a neighborhood.

## Eyasped's Conclusion
When anyone's looking into a prospective neighborhood, they look at the crime rate. Even though crimes are often intense in big cities, that doesn’t imply the neighborhood is certainly safe even if it’s in a small town. Crime statistics are usually good indicators of neighborhood safety, and safety is one of the essential indicators of a best neighborhood. But it’s not always easy to spot crime. Your quality of life can depend on your neighborhood. With the metric of police incident report, Mount Oliver Boro is the 
safest neighborhood to live with the smallest amount of police incident reports. Therefore, I found Mt. Oliver Boro to be the best neighborhood in the city of Pittsburgh.

## Jonathan's Conclusion
With infrastructure likely being one of the most consistently interacted with aspects of any city, it is vital for it to be consistently good throughout the different neighborhoods of Pittsburgh with little input being needed from those who reside there. After sorting through the different 311 requests relating to infrastructure issues for the city of Pittsburgh from 10/1/2020 to 4/1/2021, it is clear that Squirrel Hill South is the worst neighborhood in this aspect with over two hundred fifty requests during this timeframe, and that Arlington Heights and Glen Hazel are tied for best with only two requests.

## Best Overall Neighborhood
While there is no one neighborhood that is the absolute best consistently across the three metrics of project budgets, police incident reports, and infrastructure related 311 requests, the neighborhood of Allegheny West is always placed within the top fifteen neighborhoods of each. Due to this, it is safe to say that Allegheny West is the best overall neighborhood within the city of Pittsburgh ranking as fourth best budgeted neighborhood with a $6.8 million budget for neighborhood projects, tied for second safest neighborhood regarding crime with only two police incident reports over the past month, and tied for eleventh best in infrastructure with only ten infrastructure related 311 calls placed over the past six months.
